\* I2: EvalsAreSequential. Within one ENQUEUING phase, all splits with

\* I3: EventRecordedAfterEval. For every split with n_inputs > 0 that has

\* iteration. Modeled inline in EnqueueSplit; this invariant just checks

    (state = "LAUNCHED") =>

\* I6: SingleGraphLaunch — at most one cudaGraphLaunch per iter. After
