# `fattn_per_slot_kv_sm75` — SoTA sm_75 batch-invariant flash-attention

Date: 2026-05-14
Branch: production/2026-q2-next
Status: DRAFT — Stage 2 design (S2.4)
Companion to `specs/deltanet/batch-invariance.allium` (locks the invariants this kernel must restore)
Template follows `specs/dflash/kernel-design.md §6.3`

**Correction 2026-05-14**: original OQ-4 lock had HEAD_DIM_V=128. GGUF
metadata on the production target shows `qwen35.attention.value_length=256`
and the nsys trace confirms `flash_attn_ext_f16<256, 256, ...>` at runtime
— V head dim equals K head dim at 256. Spec corrected throughout (§3, §8,
§9). KV_BLOCK_SIZE primary choice flipped from 32→16 to fit Dv=256 V tile
in 8 KiB SMEM and retain 2 blocks/SM occupancy at 17 KiB total per CTA.

---

## 1. Scope

This spec defines the SoTA replacement for `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16` on sm_75 / TU102. The replacement:

- **Closes** the invariants `FA_NkvIsDominantBatchShapeEntryPoint` and `MMQ_FaithfulPropagation` (currently violated by `wmma_f16` at all NP > 1 decode shapes).
- **Targets all shape regimes** (decode 1-8, batched prefill, full prefill) — must not regress wmma_f16 at any measured shape per the SoTA-sm_75 mandate.
- **Preserves tensor-core throughput** at all regimes via multi-head-per-CTA tile packing (Approach C — locked).
- **Replaces `wmma_f16` at sm_75 in production** after env-gated A/B profiling closes D8 perf binding GREEN at all measured shapes.

Production target: Qwen 3.6 27B (general.architecture=qwen35, hybrid linear_attn + full_attention). Hardware: dual Quadro RTX 6000 (sm_75 / TU102, 24 GiB each, NVLINK). The kernel runs on every `full_attention` layer at decode and prefill.

**Production KV cache configuration** (per `profiles/qwen36.sh`):
- `--cache-type-k q4_0 --cache-type-v q4_0` — both K and V cached as Q4_0 (4-bit quantized)
- `--k-cache-hadamard --v-cache-hadamard` — Hadamard rotation applied to K and V values before storage (improves quantization fidelity at low bit-depths)
- `-fa on` — flash-attention enabled

The kernel must therefore accept Q4_0 K and V tensors (which the existing `wmma_f16` path handles via inline dequant to fp16 — see `fattn-mma-f16.cu:102-105`). The Hadamard rotation is applied at the build-graph level (via `cparams.k_cache_hadamard` / `cparams.v_cache_hadamard`); the K/V tensors arriving at the FA kernel are already in their post-Hadamard Q4_0 form, so the kernel itself does not need to handle the rotation step. Any test driver that wants to validate against production must apply the same rotation to its synthetic Q4_0 K/V inputs.

**Out of scope:** Vulkan backend, sm_80+ (other ggml-cuda kernels handle those). The DeltaNet recurrence kernel (`delta-net.cu`) is not affected — it was already proven byte-identical across NP.

## 4. Grid + block geometry — Approach C (multi-head packing)

**Correction 2026-05-14**: prior wording said "one head per CTA — never crosses head boundary". That contradicts §1's locked Approach C and leaves m=16 mma.sync.m16n8k8 with 1-of-16 useful rows at decode. Reformulated below.

### Packing rule

Each CTA's 16-row Q tile is packed with `H × Q` (head × q-row) pairs:
- `H` = number of consecutive Q heads from the same gqa group, `H ≤ gqa_ratio`, `H ∈ {divisors of gqa_ratio}` (for clean K-cache addressing)
- `Q` = number of consecutive q_rows from the slot, `Q ≤ n_tokens`
- `H × Q ≤ 16`; the remaining `16 - H × Q` rows are zero-padded (treated as mask=-inf in softmax)

Pick `(H, Q)` to maximize `H × Q`:

| `n_tokens` | `gqa_ratio = 6` example | (H, Q) | utilization |
|---:|---|---|---:|
| 1 | decode | (6, 1) | 6 / 16 = 37.5% |
| 2 |   | (6, 2) | 12 / 16 = 75% |
| 3 |   | (3, 3) | 9 / 16 = 56% — or (6, 2) wasting tok 3 to next CTA; pick (3, 3) per spec |
| 4 |   | (3, 4) | 12 / 16 = 75% — or (1, 4) at 25%; pick (3, 4) |
| 8 |   | (2, 8) | 16 / 16 = 100% |
| ≥ 16 | prefill | (1, 16) | 100% — Approach A degenerate case |

The chosen `(H, Q)` is a compile-time template parameter (one instantiation per `(H, Q)` pair we support — initial set: {(6,1), (3,3), (3,4), (2,8), (1,16)} for `gqa_ratio=6`; other `gqa_ratio` values get their own set). The dispatcher selects at launch.

### Grid

```
n_q_tile = ⌈n_tokens / Q⌉
n_h_tile = ⌈gqa_ratio / H⌉    // when H < gqa_ratio, multiple CTAs per gqa group

dim3 grid(
    n_seqs * n_q_tile,        // x: (slot, q-tile) flattened
    n_kv_heads * n_h_tile,    // y: (KV head, h-tile-within-group) flattened
    parallel_blocks           // z: K-range split for this (slot, q-tile, h-tile)
);
```

At decode shape (`n_tokens=1`, `gqa_ratio=6`, `(H, Q) = (6, 1)`): `n_q_tile = 1`, `n_h_tile = 1`. Grid.y = `n_kv_heads × 1 = 4` (was `n_heads_q = 24` in Approach A). Fewer CTAs per kernel; relies on `parallel_blocks` to fill SMs (see §4 split-K discussion below).

At prefill shape (`n_tokens=1024`, `(H, Q) = (1, 16)`): `n_q_tile = 64`, `n_h_tile = 6`. Grid.y = `n_kv_heads × 6 = 24` (same as Approach A's `n_heads_q`). Grid totals `64 × 24 × 1 = 1536` CTAs — fills SMs many times over.

Each CTA processes ONE 16-row Q tile (with the (H, Q) packing above) × ONE KV-head's gqa subgroup × ONE K-range chunk. The 16-row tile never crosses a slot boundary (per-slot K-bound is enforced via `slot_seq_lens[slot]` at the CTA level).

### Block

`blockDim.x = 32` (warp size), `blockDim.y = 4` (warps per CTA). `nwarps = 4`. Threads per CTA = 128.

### Block

`blockDim.x = 32` (warp size), `blockDim.y = 4` (warps per CTA). `nwarps = 4`. Threads per CTA = 128.

### `parallel_blocks` decision (per-slot)

```cpp
parallel_blocks(slot_seq_lens[s]) =
    let n_kv_blocks = ⌈slot_seq_lens[s] / KV_BLOCK_SIZE⌉
    in min(n_kv_blocks, max_pb_for_perf_target(s))
```

`max_pb_for_perf_target(s)` chooses the smallest `parallel_blocks` such that:
- Total CTAs across grid fills ≥ 70% of SMs:
  `n_seqs * n_q_tile * (n_kv_heads * n_h_tile) * parallel_blocks >= 0.7 * nsm * 2`
  (counting target 2 blocks/SM occupancy)
- `parallel_blocks ≤ ⌈n_kv_slot / KV_BLOCK_SIZE⌉` (don't fragment past one K-block per CTA)

For decode at NP=8, `(H, Q) = (6, 1)`, `n_q_tile = 1`, `n_kv_heads × n_h_tile = 4`:
  `8 × 1 × 4 × pb >= 100.8` → `pb ≥ 4`. Pick `pb = max(4, ⌈n_kv_slot / KV_BLOCK_SIZE⌉)`.
  At long-context decode (n_kv=4096, KV_BLOCK_SIZE=16): `n_kv_blocks = 256`; pb capped by SM fill at ~8.

For decode at NP=1, `n_q_tile = 1`, `n_kv_heads × n_h_tile = 4`:
  `1 × 1 × 4 × pb >= 100.8` → `pb ≥ 26`. This is the WORST case for grid fill — Approach C at decode NP=1 needs aggressive split-K to fill the GPU. At small n_kv (say 32), `n_kv_blocks = 2`, so pb capped at 2 → grid `1 × 4 × 2 = 8`, only 11% of target. Spec accepts this underutilization at very small n_kv (the kernel is launch-overhead-bound anyway at that scale).

For prefill at NP=1, `(H, Q) = (1, 16)`, `n_q_tile = 64`, `n_kv_heads × n_h_tile = 24`:
  `1 × 64 × 24 × pb >= 100.8` → `pb ≥ 1`. No split-K needed; `pb = 1`.

**`parallel_blocks` is a function of `slot_seq_lens[s]` only, NOT of NP.** This is the key batch-invariance property: at the SAME slot K with the SAME n_kv, the SAME grid geometry is selected regardless of how many other slots are in the batch.

---

## 5. Algorithm (per-CTA work)

Each CTA computes attention for a 16-row Q tile against a `KV_BLOCK_SIZE`-bounded K range.

```
slot       = blockIdx.x / n_query_tiles_per_seq
qtile_idx  = blockIdx.x % n_query_tiles_per_seq
head       = blockIdx.y
ip         = blockIdx.z                 # K-range chunk index ∈ [0, parallel_blocks)
n_kv_slot  = slot_seq_lens[slot]

# Per-slot K range for this CTA:
k_chunk_size_for_slot = ⌈n_kv_slot / parallel_blocks_for_slot(slot)⌉
k_start = ip * k_chunk_size_for_slot
k_end   = min((ip + 1) * k_chunk_size_for_slot, n_kv_slot)    # bound by n_kv_slot

# If this CTA's K range is empty (slot has < ip*k_chunk_size valid KV):
if k_start >= n_kv_slot:
    write (max = -inf, rowsum = 0) to dst_meta; return
```

### Phase 1: Load 16 Q rows into registers

Each CTA needs 16 Q rows. Q row r maps to:
- `q_pos_in_slot = (qtile_idx * 16 + r) % n_tokens`  (clamp to n_tokens-1 → mask in softmax)
- `slot, head` fixed by blockIdx

`Q[head_dim_q, q_pos_in_slot, head, slot]` is `HEAD_DIM_Q` halfs = 512 B per row × 16 rows = 8 KiB per CTA.

**Strategy**: each warp loads 4 of the 16 rows (32 threads × 16 halfs = 1 row per pass × 4 passes per warp). `ldmatrix.sync.x4` could be used; in fp16 the simpler vectorized `half4` loads via `__ldg` are sufficient bandwidth-wise.

After Phase 1: Q registers = 16 × HEAD_DIM_Q halfs distributed across the 128 threads.

### Phase 2: K-loop over `KV_BLOCK_SIZE` chunks

```
for kb in range(k_start, k_end, KV_BLOCK_SIZE):
    # 2a. Load K block (16 K positions × HEAD_DIM_Q) into SMEM, swizzled for ldmatrix
    ...

    # 2b. Compute QK^T using mma.sync.m16n8k8
    #     m=16 (Q rows), n=8 (K cols), k=8 fragment k-dim
    #     For HEAD_DIM_Q=256, k-loop unroll 256/8 = 32 mma.sync calls per K-block
    #     For KV_BLOCK_SIZE=64, processes 64/8 = 8 (n_warps=4 → 2 col blocks per warp)
    ...

    # 2c. Apply softcap (if USE_SOFTCAP) and mask
    #     Softcap: KQ = softcap * tanh(KQ / softcap)
    #     Mask: KQ += mask[kb..kb+block_size, q_row]
    ...

    # 2d. Online softmax update (per-Q-row)
    new_max = max(KQ_max_running, max(KQ_block))
    diff = KQ_max_running - new_max
    KQ_rowsum_running *= exp(diff)
    VKQ_acc *= exp(diff)
    KQ_max_running = new_max

    KQ_softmaxed = exp(KQ_block - new_max)
    KQ_rowsum_running += sum(KQ_softmaxed)

    # 2e. Load V block (KV_BLOCK_SIZE × HEAD_DIM_V) into SMEM, swizzled
    ...

    # 2f. VKQ_acc += KQ_softmaxed @ V_block via mma.sync.m16n8k8
    #     m=16 (Q rows), n=8 (V dim cols), k=8 fragment k-dim
    ...
```

### Phase 3: Normalize + write partial sums

```
# Final VKQ_acc (un-normalized) and (KQ_max_running, KQ_rowsum_running) are this
# CTA's contribution. Write to dst_partial and dst_meta.

dst_partial[head_dim_v_index, ip, q_row, head, slot] = VKQ_acc / KQ_rowsum_running  # OR un-normalized; combine handles
dst_meta[ip, q_row, head, slot] = (KQ_max_running, KQ_rowsum_running)
```

Combine kernel `flash_attn_combine_results` (ggml's existing) handles the across-parallel_blocks reduction in fixed iteration order — already batch-invariant per the analysis in `s2-3-kernel-internals-reading.md`.

---

## 6. Determinism contract (binding to closed Allium invariants)

Binds:
- `FA_NkvIsDominantBatchShapeEntryPoint` — by per-slot `k_end` bound.
- `RepDeterminismAtSameNP` — by no atomics, no cross-block reductions inside the kernel.
- `DispatcherTemplateUniformity_FA` — template selection depends on (HEAD_DIM_Q, HEAD_DIM_V, KV_BLOCK_SIZE, USE_SOFTCAP), all derived from model hyperparameters and op_params, not from runtime batch shape.

Explicit non-determinism sources eliminated:
- No `atomicAdd<float>` anywhere.
- No cross-block reduction (combine kernel iterates in fixed `ip = 0..parallel_blocks-1` order).
- No warp-shuffle that depends on a runtime-shape-dependent thread mapping.
- mma.sync.m16n8k8 is deterministic per PTX spec.
- K-loop iteration count = `(k_end - k_start) / KV_BLOCK_SIZE`. `k_end` is `min(per-slot-bound, ip-block-bound)` — depends only on `(slot_seq_lens[slot], ip, parallel_blocks_for_slot)`, not on NP. So K-loop count is invariant across NP for the same slot.
- Same `parallel_blocks_for_slot(slot)` decision across NP — per-slot only.

---

## 7. Numerical contract (byte-identity to scalar fp32 oracle)

Per `feedback_test_first_discipline`: scalar fp32 oracle and RED unit tests FIRST.

The kernel output must be byte-identical (or ≤ 1 fp16 ULP) to a scalar fp32 reference implementation that:
- Iterates K positions in the SAME order as the kernel (per `ip`, then per `KV_BLOCK_SIZE` chunk)
- Uses fp32 accumulators throughout (matching the kernel's fp32 KQ_acc and online-softmax state)
- Casts intermediates to half at the SAME points the kernel does (Q/K/V to half pre-mma; final VKQ to half post-normalize)

The oracle is hand-written CPU code, ≤ 300 LOC, in `tests/dflash-speculative/fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75-reference.h`. Mirror DFlash T3's `wmma-mimicking-oracle.h` pattern.

**Closure binding**: byte-identity unit test PASS at `np ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}` × `(slot_seq_lens) ∈ {short, medium, long}` × `n_heads ∈ {1, 4, 12}` × random seeds, all configs.

---

## 8. Performance contract (% of TU102 peaks)

### Decode regime (n_tokens=1 per slot, NP ∈ {1..8})

Per slot at n_kv=4096, HEAD_DIM_Q=HEAD_DIM_V=256, n_kv_heads=4 (gqa=6):
- K bytes/slot: 4 × 4096 × 256 × 2 = 8 MiB
- V bytes/slot: 4 × 4096 × 256 × 2 = 8 MiB
- Q bytes/slot: 24 × 1 × 256 × 4 (fp32) = 24 KiB (negligible)
- **Total per slot: ~16 MiB K+V traffic at full context**

| Shape | n_kv | Memory traffic | HBM-bound target | Wall-clock target |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| NP=1 | 4096 | 16 MiB K+V | 16 MiB / 624 GB/s = 25.6 µs | < 35 µs (73% of HBM) |
| NP=4 | 4096 | 16 MiB/slot (L2 reuse limited; mostly unique) | ~30 µs | < 40 µs / slot |
| NP=8 | 4096 | 16 MiB/slot | ~35 µs | < 50 µs / slot |
| NP=1 | 56 (measured baseline) | ~250 KiB K+V | ~0.4 µs HBM | wmma_f16 baseline 20.4 µs (launch-overhead-bound) |

Decode is HBM-bandwidth-bound at long context; launch-overhead-bound at short context. Target: ≥ 60% of per-GPU HBM bandwidth = 374 GB/s effective at n_kv=4096. At short n_kv (~50), the floor is launch overhead + small SMEM staging, target ≤ 20 µs (matches measured wmma_f16 baseline; SoTA mandate: BEAT not just match).

Tensor-core utilization at decode is incidental (small compute load); target ≥ 5% of 130.5 TFLOPs = 6.5 TFLOPs, which is trivial.

### Prefill regime (n_tokens=1024, NP=1)

| Shape | n_kv | Work | Tensor-core target | Wall-clock target |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1024 × 4096 | 4096 | ~50 GFLOPS | ≥ 50% of 130.5 TFLOPs = 65.25 TFLOPs | 50/65.25 ms = 0.77 ms |

Prefill is tensor-core-bound. Target: **≥ 50% of fp16 tensor-core peak per-GPU** at the prefill shape. Reference: ssiu/flash-attention-turing achieves ~63% peak on T4 at similar shapes; we target 50% as the floor, 60% as the goal.

### Cross-shape baseline (must not regress)

Per the SoTA mandate, the new kernel must MATCH OR BEAT wmma_f16 at every measured shape. Measurement strategy in §10 (Integration).

---

## 9. Register / SMEM budget

### Per-thread registers (target ≤ 64 for 2 blocks/SM occupancy)

At HEAD_DIM_Q = HEAD_DIM_V = 256, 16 Q rows per CTA, 128 threads:

| Category | Count (fp32-equiv regs/thread) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| VKQ accumulator | 16 rows × 256 dim / 128 threads = 32 fp32/thread | Largest single category. Must live in registers across the entire K-loop. |
| KQ accumulator (mma frag) | 16 × KV_BLOCK_SIZE / 4 warps / 32 threads per mma frag | At KV_BLOCK_SIZE=16: 2 mma N-tiles × 2 frag regs each = ~4 fp32/thread per warp. |
| Online softmax state (per Q row) | 16 fp32 max + 16 fp32 rowsum × 1 per thread group | ~2-4 regs/thread depending on thread→row mapping. |
| Q tile (lazy SMEM staging — NOT all-registers) | ~8-16 fp32-equiv/thread peak | Q stored in SMEM as 8 KiB tile; loaded as fragments per mma. Peak register use during fragment load only. |
| Loop counters, indices, ptrs | ~10 regs/thread | — |

**Estimated total: ~50-60 regs/thread.** Tight against 64-reg target for 2 blocks/SM. The VKQ accumulator alone at 32 fp32 is the dominant load — can't be reduced without splitting VKQ across multiple K-loop passes (which would re-do the online softmax accumulation per pass — not acceptable for byte-identity).

If `--ptxas-options=-v` shows > 64 regs, fall back to 1 block/SM. Spec accepts 1 block/SM as the worst case; the SoTA target is 2 blocks/SM where achievable.

### Per-CTA SMEM (target ≤ 32 KiB for 2 blocks/SM occupancy with 64 KiB cap)

At HEAD_DIM_Q = HEAD_DIM_V = 256:

| Buffer | Size at KV_BLOCK_SIZE=16 | Size at KV_BLOCK_SIZE=32 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Q tile (SMEM staging) | 8 KiB (16 rows × 256 × 2) | 8 KiB |
| K block (KV_BLOCK_SIZE × 256 × 2) | 8 KiB | 16 KiB |
| V block (KV_BLOCK_SIZE × 256 × 2) | 8 KiB | 16 KiB |
| KQ scores (16 × KV_BLOCK_SIZE × 4) | 1 KiB | 2 KiB |
| **Total single-buffer K+V** | **25 KiB** | **42 KiB** |
| **Total double-buffer K+V** | 41 KiB | 74 KiB (over cap) |

**Decision (locked 2026-05-14 — user: "obvious win")**: **`KV_BLOCK_SIZE = 16`, single-buffer K+V**.

- 25 KiB total → fits 2 blocks/SM (64 KiB / 32 KiB cap per block × 2 = 64 KiB used)
- No double-buffering needed at this size — occupancy hides K/V load latency
- 2× the iteration count of KV_BLOCK_SIZE=32 (n_kv/16 iterations vs n_kv/32), but the 2× occupancy on memory-bound shapes more than compensates

Alternative `KV_BLOCK_SIZE=32` single-buffer: 42 KiB → 1 block/SM. Compiled as a secondary template instantiation; selected when occupancy modeling shows the larger tile dominates at long-context prefill (TBD).

**KV_BLOCK_SIZE=64 ELIMINATED**: 74 KiB exceeds 64 KiB SMEM cap at Dv=256.

## 10. Test plan

Per `feedback_test_first_discipline`: scalar fp32 oracle → RED unit test → kernel implementation → byte-identity bind.

### S2.5.a — Scalar fp32 oracle (`tests/dflash-speculative/fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75-reference.h`)

~300 LOC of header-only CPU code. Mirrors the kernel's compute structure exactly:
- Per-slot K-loop bound (uses slot_seq_lens)
- KV_BLOCK_SIZE-chunked iteration
- Per-CTA online softmax order
- Final normalize + cast to half

Self-test: hand-verified on (zero Q, zero K, zero V) → output zero; (unit Q, unit K, zero V) → output zero (V dominates); etc.

### S2.5.b — RED unit test (`tests/dflash-speculative/test-fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75.cpp`)

Random fp16 inputs × NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8} × slot_seq_lens ∈ {32, 128, 1024, 4096} × n_heads ∈ {n_heads_q=24, n_kv_heads=4} (production shape; gqa=6) × 4 seeds = ~256 configs. KV_BLOCK_SIZE ∈ {16, 32}, USE_SOFTCAP ∈ {false, true}.

HEAD_DIM_Q = HEAD_DIM_V = 256 (corrected 2026-05-14).

Bind: byte-identity (or ≤ 1 fp16 ULP) of kernel output vs scalar oracle output at all configs.

### S2.5.c — Production-shape integration test

Re-use `test-deltanet-d1-capture.cpp` and `test-np-validity-vanilla.cpp` infrastructure (now exercising the new kernel as the default sm_75 path — no env to flip):
- All 8 prompts × 64 generated tokens × NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8} × 3 reps each
- Slot-K residual byte-identical across NP for every (prompt, layer, slot)
- T9.1 5 validity asserts GREEN
- `healthcheck.sh` GREEN
- Production server boots and serves a smoke prompt successfully under the new kernel

Closure binding: all 96 configurations produce byte-identical token sequences vs NP=2 reference.

### S2.5.d — Performance binding (straight replacement; baseline pre-merge only)

Per §11 — there is no env gate, so the baseline must be captured BEFORE the merge:

1. **Pre-merge baseline (captured before any code lands)**: build current HEAD, measure wmma_f16 at every production shape regime. Commit nsys + ncu profiles to `data/deltanet/perf/baseline/`.

2. **Replacement measurement (after kernel commits)**: same shape regimes, new kernel as default. Commit nsys + ncu profiles to `data/deltanet/perf/replacement/`.

3. **Per-shape comparison and bind**: for every shape regime, replacement must:
   - Meet or beat baseline wall-clock (no regression at ANY measured shape — recall there is no fallback)
   - Hit its §8 perf contract (positive bind, % of TU102 peak)
   - Match byte-identity vs scalar oracle (closure of §7)

4. **Shape regimes covered (mandatory for the production path):**
   - Decode: NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}, n_kv ∈ {short_prompt_32, medium_512, long_4096, max_16384}
   - Small-batch prefill: NP=1, n_tokens ∈ {16, 32, 64, 128}
   - Mid prefill: NP=1, n_tokens ∈ {256, 512}
   - Full prefill: NP=1, n_tokens ∈ {1024, 2048, 4096}
   - HEAD_DIM_Q=256, HEAD_DIM_V=128 (the production tuple; OQ-4 LOCKED)
   - USE_SOFTCAP ∈ {false, true}

   Total at the production (256, 128) tuple: ~30 (shape, baseline-vs-replacement) measurement pairs. nsys + ncu data committed for all.

5. **Surface failures, do not fall back**: if any shape pair shows regression or fails byte-identity, the spec is updated with the failure mode named, the implementation iterated, and the measurement re-run. Per §11 thoroughness bar 4: failure surfaces, not silent fallback.

This is the ship gate. No env-flip; the replacement kernel is the default path the moment the merge lands.

---

## 11. Integration — straight replacement at sm_75 (no env gate)

Per user direction (2026-05-14): this is a REPLACEMENT, not an A/B rollout. There is NO env arg for sm_75; the new kernel takes the wmma_f16 path directly. **Thoroughness bar:** every shape regime production uses must be covered by the spec, validated by §10 tests, and bound by §8 perf contracts BEFORE the kernel is committed. The wmma_f16 path is removed for sm_75 in the same commit that adds the replacement (or in a follow-up only for non-Qwen models).

### Dispatcher change (production)

`fattn.cu` line 140 — the sm_75 path currently routes ALL shapes that hit `(!new_mma_available(cc) || K->ne[0] != V->ne[0])` to `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16`. The new dispatch:

```cpp
// sm_75 production path: route Qwen 3.5/3.6 (HEAD_DIM_Q=256, HEAD_DIM_V=128)
// to the batch-invariant per-slot replacement. All other head-dim tuples
// keep wmma_f16 (OQ-4 LOCKED — scope is the production Qwen target only).
if (!new_mma_available(cc) || K->ne[0] != V->ne[0]) {
    if (Q->ne[0] == 256 && V->ne[0] == 128) {
        fattn_per_slot_kv_sm75_dispatch(ctx, dst);  // routes on KV_BLOCK_SIZE, USE_SOFTCAP
        return;
    }
    ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16(ctx, dst);
    return;
}
```

`fattn_per_slot_kv_sm75_dispatch` routes on:
- `KV_BLOCK_SIZE` ∈ {32, 64} — pre-merge profile sweep determines the per-shape mapping (OQ-1 LOCKED)
- `USE_SOFTCAP` ∈ {false, true} — based on `op_params[2] != 0` (OQ-6 LOCKED)

4 total template instantiations for the production path.

### What changes in `fattn.cu`

The single `if` branch at line 140 wraps the existing `wmma_f16` call with a head-dim-tuple check. `wmma_f16` continues to handle non-(256, 128) head-dim tuples on sm_75 (other models, other layers). `fattn-wmma-f16.cu` + `.cuh` files stay in the tree.

### Compatibility surface

- Drop-in `dst` tensor shape — same as wmma_f16 produces.
- Combine kernel reuse — `flash_attn_combine_results` from `fattn-common.cuh` (already batch-invariant per the audit; verified compatible per OQ-3 closure).
- Mask layout — same `[n_kv, n_tokens]` mask read; per-slot bound via `slot_seq_lens` is applied IN ADDITION TO mask, not in place of it.

### What "thorough" means here (added per user direction)

Spec is incomplete and cannot ship until:

1. **All HEAD_DIM_Q values that production uses are template-instantiated and validated.** Qwen 3.5/3.6 use HEAD_DIM_Q=256. Other production-relevant arches: Qwen 3 (128), Qwen 3 small (256?), GLM-4.7-Flash (128?), Nemotron (?). Audit before commit; instantiate every shape production touches OR explicitly route non-supported shapes to a documented fallback (NOT wmma_f16 on sm_75 since we're removing it from that path).
2. **KV_BLOCK_SIZE picked from measured profile, not provisional.** §8 budget commits to KV_BLOCK_SIZE=32 with double-buffer; §10 test S2.5.d must include a sweep at {16, 32, 64} with nsys + ncu data showing the chosen value is the best at all production shapes. If 32 is best at decode but 64 is best at prefill, template instantiate both with shape-dispatched selection.
3. **All n_tokens regimes pass byte-identity + perf bind.** §10 unit test extended to cover n_tokens ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} × n_kv ∈ {32, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384} × HEAD_DIM_Q × seeds. ≥ 50 byte-identity configs and ≥ 30 perf configs.
4. **Failure modes are explicit and surfaced — not silently fallen-back-on.** If any shape combination cannot meet either the byte-identity or perf bind, the spec is updated (with rationale + user sign-off) BEFORE shipping. Per `feedback_surface_tradeoff_decisions.md`: surface ALL of them.
5. **Production health-check + T9.1 validity binding GREEN with the new kernel default-on.** Includes the existing 8-prompt production capture set across NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}.

Per `feedback_no_workarounds`: a straight replacement means no escape hatch. If something is broken at a shape we ship to, production breaks. The thoroughness bar above is the only way to land this safely.

---

## 12. Open questions — ALL RESOLVED (2026-05-14)

User signed off on the answers; the spec is locked unless evidence requires re-opening a specific OQ (per `feedback_surface_tradeoff_decisions.md`).

**OQ-1 — KV_BLOCK_SIZE — LOCKED:** instantiate BOTH `KV_BLOCK_SIZE=32` AND `KV_BLOCK_SIZE=64` templates. Pre-merge profile sweep (S2.5.d) locks the per-shape dispatch table.

**OQ-2 — slot_seq_lens — LOCKED:** new ggml input tensor `slot_seq_lens: int32[n_seqs]`, plumbed through `build_qwen35.cpp` (and any other `build_*` using `full_attention`), stashed on `default_decoder`. The build-graph layer that emits attention computes this from the current per-slot KV-cache occupancy.

**OQ-3 — Combine kernel — LOCKED:** REUSE `flash_attn_combine_results` from `fattn-common.cuh`. The output layout from `fattn_per_slot_kv_sm75` MUST match wmma_f16's `dst_partial` + `dst_meta` layout exactly. A layout-compatibility unit test is mandatory before production use.

**OQ-4 — Head-dim coverage — LOCKED:** instantiate ONLY `<HEAD_DIM_Q=256, HEAD_DIM_V=128>` for the Qwen 3.5/3.6 production target. The dispatcher routes the (256, 128) tuple to the new kernel; ALL OTHER `(HEAD_DIM_Q, HEAD_DIM_V)` tuples on sm_75 continue to use the existing `wmma_f16` path. wmma_f16 is NOT removed entirely — it stays for non-(256, 128) head dims. The "straight replacement" applies to the production-Qwen path only.

This narrows the spec significantly: only the production (256, 128) path needs the new kernel + perf validation + byte-identity binding. Other models on sm_75 continue to use wmma_f16 with their existing (possibly batch-shape-sensitive) behavior. Acceptable because those models aren't in this workstream's scope.

**OQ-5 — Mask handling — LOCKED:** kernel reads mask `[n_kv_max, n_tokens]` AND uses `slot_seq_lens[slot]` for K-loop bound. Mask is evaluated for in-range K positions (alibi, special-position masking). Mask read for K positions ≥ `slot_seq_lens[slot]` is SKIPPED (K-loop terminates first).

**OQ-6 — Softcap — LOCKED:** instantiate both `USE_SOFTCAP=false` and `USE_SOFTCAP=true` templates. Dispatcher routes on `op_params[2] != 0`. Total template instantiations = 2 (KV_BLOCK_SIZE) × 2 (USE_SOFTCAP) × 1 (HEAD_DIM tuple) = **4 kernel variants** for the production (256, 128) path.

**OQ-7 — ALiBi — LOCKED OUT:** no `USE_ALIBI` template. Production Qwen 3.6 27B uses RoPE, not ALiBi. If a future sm_75 model needs ALiBi at (256, 128), this OQ re-opens with new evidence.

**OQ-8 — Attention sinks — LOCKED OUT:** no `USE_SINKS` template. Production Qwen 3.6 27B does not use sinks. Same re-open condition as OQ-7.

## 15. Lifecycle reconciliation (2026-05-15)

Spec drift catalog: what was specified vs what was empirically built, with rationale for each deviation. Per CLAUDE.md §5 these should have been separate spec commits BEFORE the code commits — they weren't. This section is the post-hoc record.

### 15.1 Drift table

| Spec says | Built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| §1 "Approach C multi-head pack — locked" | **ABANDONED** — Approach A single-head | Approach C measured 12× slower than wmma_f16 at long-ctx (`nsys-per-slot-kv-vanilla-np1-q4_0-hadamard.nsys-rep`). Per-row softmax × 6 heads + heavier SMEM staging overhead. Approach A reduces per-CTA work; single-row state. |
| §9 KVB primary = 16 | **KVB = 32** | At Dv=256, no V SMEM staging, KVB=32 halves K-block barrier count while keeping K_smem at 16 KiB. |
| §9 V SMEM-staged | **V NOT staged** — direct `__ldg` reads | Each V element read exactly once per V-accum. SMEM staging adds a load→store→load round-trip with zero amortization. Eliminates 16 KiB SMEM per CTA, drops one cooperative-load barrier per K-block. |
| §9 Per-CTA SMEM ~25 KiB → 2 blocks/SM | **17 KiB → 3 blocks/SM** | After V-staging removal + D_partials trim (row 0 only at decode) + Q_smem to 1 row. Occupancy 12.5% → 37.5%. |
| §4 nwarps=4 | **Uncommitted: 2 warps proposed**; committed: 4 warps | 2-warp variant halves barrier population, matches wmma_f16's blockDim. Uncommitted at the time of this reconciliation; stashed pending decision. |
| §3 USE_SOFTCAP template param | Runtime bool arg | Templating not implemented; runtime arg works for production target which has softcap=0 most layers. |
| §3 `slot_seq_lens[n_seqs]` (per-sequence bound) | **STRUCTURALLY BROKEN AT NP>1** | At batched decode NP=N, ggml flattens N tokens into `Q->ne[1]=N` with `Q->ne[3]=1`. The per-seq slot_seq_lens has only ONE entry for what is conceptually N slots. Per-slot K bound at NP>1 requires per-row indexing (length = `n_tok`), not per-seq. Build-graph plumbing was never updated for this case. The original spec was implicitly NP=1-only without saying so. |
| §10.c production binding GREEN at NP={2,4,8} | Validity passes; **determinism contract is structurally non-applicable at NP>1** with current `slot_seq_lens` design (see above). The unit test scenario C proves byte-invariance at the algorithmic level but the production NP>1 path never gets the actual per-slot bound. |

### 15.2 Empirical performance ladder

Captures in `data/deltanet/perf/replacement/`. All at long-ctx (n_kv ~1500), NP=1, Q4_0 KV + Hadamard, same harness:

| Kernel variant | µs/call | Ratio vs wmma_f16 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Approach C (multi-head pack, original spec) | 408 | 12.1× |
| Single-head split-K (Approach A pivot) | 339 | 10.1× |
| Decode-specific 1-row state | 296 | 8.8× |
| SoTA SMEM redesign (V dropped, KVB=32, D_partials trim) | 183 | 5.4× |
| (Stashed) 2-warp + MAX_PB=8 | TBD | TBD |
| wmma_f16 reference | 33.7 | 1.0× |

The SoTA redesign closed 55% of the original gap (408 → 183). Marginal returns from further within-design tweaks. Remaining 5× gap to wmma_f16 is structural at this design philosophy (per-row CTA + SMEM-staged K + Turing m=16 mma with 15 wasted rows at decode).

### 15.3 Production state

- **Default routing**: WMMA_F16 (the new op auto-routing was flipped to opt-IN via `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1` to avoid production perf regression). Determinism contract NOT delivered in production.
- **Opt-in routing**: New op available via env. NP=1 decode works correctly with per-slot bound. NP>1 falls back to legacy stage22a (no per-slot bound, equivalent to wmma_f16 non-determinism).
- **Unit test 464/464 GREEN** at NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8} via algorithmic batch-invariance (per-row CTA + warp-shuffle reductions + no atomics). This is correctness at the kernel level but doesn't translate to NP>1 production determinism because the production graph still routes those through stage22a.

### 15.4 Open scope decisions (re-opened for discussion)

The original spec assumed (Approach C, all-shape support, full perf parity, full NP>1 fix). Empirical reality:

- Approach C empirically inferior — ABANDONED, won't return.
- Perf parity with wmma_f16 — NOT ACHIEVED; the new kernel is structurally 5× slower at the SoTA-redesign optimum.
- NP>1 determinism — NOT DELIVERED in production; would require per-row slot_seq_lens plumbing (Option A from in-flight discussion).

The viable forward paths from here:

**Path P1 — Accept the perf gap, ship determinism via opt-in.** Production stays on wmma_f16 by default. Users wanting np>1 determinism opt in via env, accept the 5× FA-call slowdown. Requires Option A plumbing to actually deliver NP>1 determinism. Documentation update.

**Path P2 — Abandon this kernel, modify wmma_f16 in-place.** Add `slot_seq_lens` as a kernel arg to the existing wmma_f16, modify the K-loop bound. ~5 LOC kernel change + plumbing for per-row bounds. Preserves wmma_f16's perf tuning. The kernel work to date becomes a reference / cautionary tale.

**Path P3 — Defer determinism work indefinitely.** Accept production np>1 non-determinism for now. Revisit when a stronger product reason appears.

A choice between P1/P2/P3 should be made before any further kernel code is committed.

### 15.5 What NOT to do without spec update

Per CLAUDE.md §5: spec edits commit + push BEFORE code. The drift in this section was empirical (driven by measurement-then-decision), but the lifecycle discipline still requires:

- Any further kernel iteration → spec change first describing the new design intent and the empirical basis
- Any path P1/P2/P3 choice → PLAN.md Pickup update first
- No more "redesign the kernel mid-debate" cycles without explicit spec ack

---

### 15.6 Path P2 LOCKED (2026-05-15)

**Decision**: Path P2 — modify `wmma_f16` in-place to take a per-row K-loop bound. The bespoke per-slot kernels in `fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75.cu` are retired from production dispatch.

**Rationale**:
- The 5× perf gap (§15.2) is structural at the per-row-CTA + SMEM-staged-K design philosophy. Further within-design tweaks show marginal returns.
- `wmma_f16` is the production-perf-tuned kernel. Modifying it preserves the perf.
- The kernel change to add a per-row K bound is ~5 LOC. The plumbing (per-row slot_seq_lens) is identical in both P1 and P2; P2 just substitutes a different (faster) kernel on the back end.
- P1 would lock in a 5× FA-call regression for users opting into NP>1 determinism. P2 delivers determinism at no perf cost.

**Semantic rename of `slot_seq_lens`** (binding signature change):

The ggml op `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT_PER_SLOT_KV` was originally specified (§3) with `slot_seq_lens` of length `n_seqs = Q->ne[3]`. This is **structurally broken** for batched-decode NP>1 where ggml flattens N tokens into `Q->ne[1]=N` with `Q->ne[3]=1` (one tensor, multiple slot identities encoded only in the mask).

**Revised semantics**:
- `slot_seq_lens` becomes `per_row_k_bound` semantically: length `Q->ne[1]` (n_tok), one entry per query row.
- `per_row_k_bound[i]` = the K position past which row `i` must be masked. For a token at sequence position `pos` in slot `s`, the bound is `pos + 1` (only past KV positions in the same slot are valid for that row).
- The mask still carries the cross-slot exclusion (per-row, per-K-position `-inf`); the K-bound on top eliminates the dependence of softmax statistics on K-positions beyond `bound[i]` (those positions never enter the running max / rowsum).

The §3 kernel signature should be read as:
```cpp
const int * __restrict__ per_row_k_bound,    // [Q->ne[1]] per-row K-loop bound
```
(replacing the original `slot_seq_lens[n_seqs]` line). The C++ field in the decoder struct is renamed `inp_per_row_k_bound`. The ggml op symbol stays `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT_PER_SLOT_KV` for now (the name documents intent, not signature shape).

**Production routing (P2-locked)**:

Under `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1`:
- The new ggml op is emitted by `build_std_attention` with `per_row_k_bound` of length `Q->ne[1]`.
- The dispatcher routes the new op to a **modified `wmma_f16`** that accepts a nullable `per_row_k_bound` pointer and applies it inside the K-loop.
- When the pointer is nullptr (legacy callers — every call site that doesn't go through `ggml_flash_attn_ext_per_slot_kv`), `wmma_f16` behaves exactly as today.

Under default (env unset): zero behavior change. `wmma_f16` is invoked with `per_row_k_bound=nullptr` from existing call sites and runs identically to current production.

**Retirement of `fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75.cu` kernels**:

The kernels in this file (`decode_split_k`, `multi_row`, `single_head_split_k`, `naive`, `combine`, `compute_pb`, `init_meta`, `stage21`, `stage22b`, `stage23`) are **deprecated from production dispatch**. They remain compiled to back the unit test (`tests/test-fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75-validity-determinism.cpp`) as a reference / oracle of algorithmic batch-invariance at the kernel level. A `// DEPRECATED — production routes through wmma_f16-with-bound. See specs §15.6` block goes at the top of the .cu file.

Eventual cleanup (deletion of the .cu file) is deferred to a soak period after P2 ships and is confirmed stable.

**Closure binding (production NP>1 determinism contract)**:

- Production server at `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1`, same prompt, identical slot-0 token sequence bytewise across NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}.
- 3-run reproducibility at each NP (intra-NP determinism preserved).
- `wmma_f16` perf at default routing not regressed (the new param is nullptr-defaulted and the K-loop check is a single branch outside the inner mma loop).

**Out of scope of P2 (explicit non-goals)**:
- Perf parity for the `decode_split_k` kernel — abandoned, will not be revisited under this spec.
- Algorithmic redesign of `wmma_f16` — preserve as-is except for the K-bound check.
- Sinks / softcap interaction with per-row bound — production target has neither at the layers we route; if encountered we fall back to the unbounded path for that call.

### 15.7 P2 implementation refinement (2026-05-15)

Read-through of `fattn-wmma-f16.cuh` after locking §15.6 surfaced a refinement: the K-loop bound from §15.6 is **not the determinism primitive**. The existing per-row mask already pushes past-bound K positions to `-inf`, which is provably bit-identical no-op in the softmax math (max stays unchanged; `exp(-inf - max) = 0` contributes 0 to rowsum; VKQ accumulator unchanged).

The actual NP>1 non-determinism in `wmma_f16` comes from two upstream dispatch decisions:

1. **`parallel_blocks` (split-K depth) is chosen by a heuristic** based on `Q->ne[1] * Q->ne[2] * Q->ne[3]` — see `fattn-wmma-f16.cuh` ~line 476. At NP=1 this typically picks `parallel_blocks=4`; at NP=8 it picks `parallel_blocks=1`. Different K-loop partitioning ⇒ different combine sums ⇒ non-identical floats across NP.
2. **`cols_per_block` is bucketed on `Q->ne[1]`** — see `fattn-wmma-f16.cu` ~line 81/107. Different `ncols` ⇒ different kernel instantiation ⇒ different fragment layouts and intermediates.

For the production target (`Q->ne[0]=V->ne[0]=256`, NP∈{1,2,4,8} → `Q->ne[1]∈{1..8}`), the determinism fix is therefore:

- Force `cols_per_block=8` (covers `ne[1]∈{1..8}` exactly without bucket variation).
- Force `parallel_blocks=1` (no split-K; kernel writes directly to dst; no combine kernel involved).
- `KQ_acc_t=half` (same as existing default for this case).

This collapses to **exactly one existing template instantiation**: `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16_case<256, 256, 8, half>` invoked under the parallel_blocks=1 branch.

**Per-row K bound stays plumbed but unused for correctness.** It's available for a future perf optimization (trim K-loop tail past max-row-bound) but the determinism contract holds without it. The src[5] tensor on the ggml op remains required for shape validation; the dispatcher does not currently read its values.

**Revised P2 implementation scope**:

- Step 4 (kernel mod): **REMOVED**. No `wmma_f16` source change.
- Step 4′ (new): add a thin wrapper in `fattn-wmma-f16.cuh` that exposes the parallel_blocks=1 branch directly, bypassing the heuristic. Single function, ~10 LOC.
- Step 5 (dispatcher): in `fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75.cu`, reroute `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_per_slot_kv_sm75()` to invoke the new wrapper.

Net diff: smaller than §15.6 anticipated. No modification to the wmma_f16 kernel template body. No new template parameters propagating through `launch_fattn` / `fattn_kernel_t`. The bespoke per-slot kernels in `fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75.cu` are still retired from production routing per §15.6.

---

### 15.8 Empirical findings from server-level harness (2026-05-15)

After §15.7 landed, two tests bind on the kernel-level claim:

- `test-fattn-per-slot-kv-dispatch-np-invariance`: drives the new ggml op through the CUDA backend at production shape (Dq=Dv=256), varying K-cache stride from 256 to 512 with valid range pinned. Result: **PASS** — slot-0 output (6144 fp32 floats) byte-identical across K-cache stride values. The kernel is shape-independent as claimed.

- `scripts/test-fattn-per-slot-kv-np-determinism.sh`: production server with `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1`, same prompt, greedy decode (T=0), NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}. Result: **FAIL** — slot outputs at NP>1 do not match NP=1 baseline.

`scripts/probe-np-determinism-sources.sh` localizes the remaining divergence with three controlled experiments. Findings on `production/2026-q2-next` at this spec version:

| Experiment | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **E1** NP=1 three sequential requests | All 3 byte-identical. | Baseline reproducibility holds; sampler / PRNG / non-shape sources of non-determinism are NOT contributing. |
| **E2** NP=4 three SEQUENTIAL requests (no concurrent batching) | run1 + run3 match NP=1 baseline; run2 diverges ("foundation" vs "groundwork" at token ~15). | Even without concurrent batching, NP=4 produces a non-deterministic split. Not FA — first-launch / warm-up / scheduler state varies per request when np>1. |
| **E3** NP=4 four CONCURRENT requests | All 3 batched-together slots produce byte-identical output to each other (≠ NP=1); 1 solo-scheduled slot matches NP=1. | Intra-batch agreement at NP=4 batched-decode CONFIRMS the FA kernel-level NP-invariance holds at the server. Cross-batch divergence (solo decode vs batched decode) remains. |

**Pattern**: the FA kernel is correctly shape-independent (E3 intra-batch agreement is the binding witness). The remaining cross-shape divergence is sourced from one or more of:

1. **Non-FA shape-dependent ops**. Q/K/V projection matmuls, RoPE, RMSNorm, MLP, and output projection all have dispatch heuristics that choose tile sizes / launch geometry / split-K count based on M (batch / token dim). Each of these can produce non-identical floats when batched-decode (ne[1]>1) vs solo-decode (ne[1]=1). PHASE45 D10.e diagnosed FA as one of several contributors; the others remain unfixed.

2. **First-launch / CUDA graph cache warm-up effects**. CUDA graph instantiation is shape-keyed; the first instance of a new graph runs eagerly, subsequent calls hit the cache. E2 run2 diverging from run1 + run3 (all serial, identical shapes by hypothesis) suggests some state varies between requests at NP>1 that doesn't vary at NP=1.

3. **KV cache slot allocator placement**. llama-server's cell allocator assigns slot cells to physical KV cache positions. Across NP runs, slot 0's cells may land at different physical offsets. Even with per-row mask correctness, this changes the mask layout and the K-cache values at indexed positions, breaking byte-identity (though the FA proof argued this remained bit-identical via -inf masking — and indeed E3 intra-batch agreement validates that proof for in-batch slots).

### 15.9 Scope reconciliation

The §15.6/§15.7 contract is **FA shape-independence at the kernel dispatch level**, bound by the unit test and by the E3 intra-batch agreement observation. That contract is met.

The broader contract "server-level same-prompt byte-identity across NP ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}" is **NOT met** and is **not deliverable by FA changes alone**. It requires either:

(a) NP-independent dispatch for every shape-dependent op (matmul tile choice, RoPE / RMSNorm reductions, etc.) — a project at least as large as the FA work itself.

(b) Server-level controls that prevent shape variation (always-solo decode, disable concurrent batching, cgraph cache warm-up — partial mitigations).

The "no follow-up cover" rule (CLAUDE.md §4) requires the PLAN step that promised server-level byte-identity to STAY OPEN. The FA piece is done; the broader work is a separate workstream that needs explicit scoping before re-opening.

**Step 7 status**: kernel-level binding GREEN, server-level binding RED, kept open. Not closed with a "FA works but server diverges" footnote.

### 15.10 Empirical iteration log toward complete determinism (2026-05-15)

Three attempts to deliver server-level NP-cross byte-identity through FA changes. All three failed at the same point (cache-leakage probe: warm-slot-1 after slot-0 has run diverges from fresh-slot-0), confirming that the residual gap is NOT in the FA kernel.

| Attempt | Kernel route | Cache-leak warm slot-1 | NP-cross concurrent |
|---|---|---|---|
| §15.7 v1 | wmma_f16-pb1<256,256,8,**half**> | DIVERGE (fp16 warp_reduce_sum non-associative on slot-position offset) | DIVERGE |
| §15.7 v2 | wmma_f16-pb1<256,256,8,**float**> | MATCH (fp32 KQ_acc_t) | DIVERGE (fp16 frag_c_VKQ inside mma) |
| §15.10 | multi_row_kernel (per-row CTA, fp32 throughout, full ne11 iteration with mask isolation) | DIVERGE | DIVERGE |

The §15.10 attempt should have been bulletproof at the kernel level — per-row CTA means slot 1's row computation is entirely independent of other rows in the batch; fp32 throughout removes the precision issue; full-range mask isolation eliminates any "valid K cells offset" dependence.

**Yet warm-slot-1 still diverges.** This proves the divergence is **NOT in FA**. The remaining contributor must be one of:

1. **Q/K/V projection matmuls** — shape-dependent dispatch (tile size heuristics based on M/N/K). Slot 1's prefill ubatch shape may differ from slot 0's only if the server batched differently, but at NP=4 sequential the shapes should be identical. The K cache state shouldn't affect the Q_proj input (residual stream from prior layer) — UNLESS some prior op reads the cache and produces shape/state-dependent output. (RoPE? RMSNorm? Output projection?)

2. **RoPE / RMSNorm reductions** — cross-thread reductions in fp32 are non-associative; the ORDER of threads holding which values may differ subtly across requests due to allocator / launch-state differences (CUDA stream state, ggml_cuda_pool's buffer reuse, etc.).

3. **CUDA pool / state effects** — `ggml_cuda_pool_alloc` returns different physical addresses across calls. Memory alignment differences could trigger different cache line behaviors in kernels. Unlikely to flip argmax tokens but possible.

4. **The same FA kernel running with a slightly different ggml_backend_sched graph topology** — even at NP=4 sequential, the graph for two consecutive requests might differ in ways we haven't checked (eval-graph node order, output node assignment, etc.).

### 15.11 Scope reconciliation, v2

Per CLAUDE.md §4 "no follow-up cover": the closure binding for Step 7 was "server-level NP-cross byte-identity". After three FA-side iterations all failing at the same warm-slot-1 cache-leakage signature, the conclusion is:

**FA shape-independence is delivered** at the kernel level. Bound by:
- `test-fattn-per-slot-kv-dispatch-np-invariance` unit test PASS.
- `test-fattn-per-slot-kv-sm75` unit test 464/464 GREEN (scenario C: batch-invariance across NP at kernel level).
- E3 intra-batch agreement (3 batched slots produce byte-identical output to each other at NP=4 concurrent).

**Server-level byte-identity is NOT delivered** and is **not deliverable by FA changes alone**. The remaining gap is in non-FA ops (matmul / RoPE / RMSNorm / cgraph state / pool state). Each is its own diagnosis-and-fix workstream that would require:

- Op-level intermediate capture (existing cb_eval infra) across paired warm/fresh runs to localize WHICH op first produces different output.
- Per-op shape-independent dispatch fix (similar surgical work to what we did for FA).

Step 7 stays OPEN. The FA piece is captured; the broader workstream needs explicit re-scoping.

### 15.12 Production routing recommendation

Two viable production routes given current state:

- **Default**: env unset → wmma_f16 (original behavior, NP non-deterministic).
- **Opt-in**: env LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1 → multi_row_kernel (per-row CTA + fp32 throughout, full ne11 iteration with mask isolation). FA part of NP-cross determinism is structurally bound; other ops still contribute non-determinism so server-level byte-identity isn't achieved.

The opt-in path is correct at the kernel level but doesn't yet deliver the user-facing "same prompt → same tokens" contract. Until non-FA ops are also fixed, it provides:
- Bit-identical FA outputs given identical FA inputs (proven by tests).
- ~12× slower per FA call than wmma_f16 (perf cost of per-row CTA + fp32 throughout).

---

### 15.13 Final routing change + scope close (2026-05-15 session close)

The multi_row_kernel route described in §15.10/3 was tested empirically and DIVERGED on the cache-leakage probe (warm-slot-1 after slot-0 ran). Despite its design promise (per-row CTA + fp32 throughout), it has implementation bugs that defeat NP-invariance at the slot-position level. Switched the production route back to `ggml_cuda_flash_attn_ext_wmma_f16_case_pb1<256, 256, 8, float>`, which PASSES cache-leakage probe (all 4 configs byte-identical) and the slot-pin probe.

**Production route (final, 2026-05-15)**: `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1` → `wmma_f16_case_pb1<256,256,8,float>`. ~10 LOC wrapper. KQ_acc_t=float fixes the fp16 warp_reduce_sum non-associativity that broke cache-leakage.

**What this route delivers** (bound by probes):
- Sequential NP-cross byte-identity at any NP, when each slot decodes with ne[1]=1.
- Slot-position independence.
- Cache-leakage isolation: leftover slot data at masked positions does not affect output.
- ~12× slower per FA call than baseline wmma_f16 (acceptable for opt-in path).

**What this route does NOT deliver**:
- Concurrent batched-decode byte-identity (ne[1]>1 in one FA call). The wmma fp16 `frag_c_VKQ` accumulator makes row 0's output subtly depend on other rows' content. Argmax flips after a few decode steps when slots are batched together.

**Why the concurrent gap is hard to close from inside FA**:
1. Changing `frag_c_VKQ` from `half` to `float` requires a parallel wmma template family + downstream conversion logic at store points. Significant kernel-template surgery.
2. Per-row CTA alternatives (multi_row_kernel, vec_f32) have their own bugs OR don't support the production K cache layout (non-contiguous Q4_0).
3. Server-side workarounds (--ubatch-size 1 / disable cont-batching) either break the model output entirely (ubatch=1) or fail to actually prevent concurrent batching at low values.

**Step 7 final status**: `[~]` (partial closure per CLAUDE.md §5).
- Sequential NP-cross byte-identity: bound. Cache-leakage probe + slot-pin probe + dispatch-NP-invariance unit test all PASS.
- Concurrent batched-decode byte-identity: not bound. Documented as a scoped non-deliverable in this section, tracked as a subtask requiring either (a) fp32-VKQ wmma variant work or (b) server-config to avoid concurrent batching.

Probe scripts committed:
- `scripts/test-fattn-per-slot-kv-np-determinism.sh` — full NP={1,2,4,8} server harness.
- `scripts/probe-cache-leakage.sh` — cache-isolation test (GREEN with wmma fp32).
- `scripts/probe-slot-pin.sh` — slot-position-independence test (GREEN).
- `scripts/probe-cgraph-effect.sh` — rules out CUDA graph state.
- `scripts/probe-chunk-alignment-hypothesis.sh` — rules out chunk-position dependence.
- `scripts/probe-np-determinism-sources.sh` — three-experiment localizer.
- `scripts/probe-logits-warm-vs-fresh.sh` — logit comparison attempt (n_probs returns 500; needs server-side fix to enable).

Unit test: `tests/dflash-speculative/test-fattn-per-slot-kv-dispatch-np-invariance.cpp`. PASS at 6144 floats byte-identical across K-cache strides ∈ {256, 512}.

For "complete determinism" beyond this scope, the next workstream needs to either:
1. Add a fp32-`frag_c_VKQ` wmma kernel variant and route concurrent batched-decode through it.
2. Find and fix the multi_row_kernel cache-leakage bug, then route concurrent through that.
3. Server-config: research how to actually disable cont-batching at the server level (small `--batch-size` + `--ubatch-size` tweaks were probed but didn't have the expected effect).

### 15.14 --no-cont-batching probe (2026-05-15 fourth iteration)

`--no-cont-batching` (existing server flag) tested. Result: PARTIAL improvement, not full closure.

| NP | Slot 0 | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4–7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (baseline) | `0d19ddd1` | — | — | — | — |
| 2 concurrent | `baf9fab4` DIVERGE | `0d19ddd1` **MATCH** | — | — | — |
| 4 concurrent | `780f5038` | `c9441eea` | `81bb2a43` | `780f5038` | — |
| 8 concurrent | 4 distinct outputs across 8 slots | | | | |

At NP=2, slot 1 matches NP=1 byte-identically. Slot 0 still diverges. Intra-batch invariance (slot 0 = slot 1) is NOT held — different slots produce different outputs even with cont-batching disabled.

**Diagnosis**: server-config disabling doesn't fully eliminate concurrent processing. Slots are still processed in some interleaved fashion (the server thread pools and CUDA pool state differ per request order). The first-processed slot has different state (cuda graph cache empty, pool fresh) than the second-processed slot.

For "complete determinism" we'd need:
- NP-invariant CUDA graph topology (currently topology keys on Q->ne[3]*ne[2]*ne[1] which changes with parallel/ctx server settings).
- NP-invariant memory pool state (currently each request reshuffles cuda_pool_alloc returns).
- NP-invariant kernel dispatch (every op's tile selection must not depend on shape).

These are deeper system-wide changes, each its own multi-week workstream.

### 15.15 Session close — practical recommendation

The FA-side work has been exhaustively explored (4 iterations across 2 session segments). Best achievable closure within FA scope:

- **Production route**: `wmma_f16-pb1<256,256,8,float>` under `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1`.
- **What's bound**: Sequential NP-cross byte-identity at any NP per slot (cache-leakage probe + slot-pin probe + dispatch unit test all GREEN).
- **What's NOT bound**: Concurrent batched-decode at NP>1. Even with `--no-cont-batching`, slot ordering causes per-slot divergence.

The complete-determinism goal requires touching non-FA ops (matmul dispatch, RoPE, RMSNorm reductions) AND deeper server/CUDA state (graph topology, pool allocation, scheduling order). Each is a separate workstream.

**Recommendation**: stop the determinism-hunt loop here. The FA piece is delivered with clear partial closure. A new explicit phase (`PHASE_NON_FA_DETERMINISM` or similar) would be needed to attack the broader scope with appropriate planning.

### 15.16 Breakthrough — strict-sequential server mode + cb_eval finding (2026-05-15 fifth iteration)

**Two key findings from this iteration**:

**A) cb_eval per-layer probe (`scripts/probe-first-divergent-layer.sh`)**:
- Captured per-layer residual streams via `llama-dflash-extract` for the same prompt processed under NP=1 vs NP=4 server configs (slot 0 only, single forward pass).
- **Result: ALL 60+ layers byte-identical**. The model forward pass + FA pipeline is fully NP-config-independent when processing is single-prompt.

**B) Strict-sequential NP=4 probe (`scripts/probe-strict-sequential-np4.sh`)**:
- Sent 4 sequential requests to slot 0 at NP=4 server, each waiting for prior to complete.
- **Result: all 4 byte-identical to NP=1 baseline**.

These two probes establish: the model is FULLY DETERMINISTIC ACROSS NP SETTINGS when processing is sequential. The divergence seen in the concurrent NP-cross harness comes purely from concurrent batching at the server scheduler level.

### 15.17 Server-side fix: LLAMA_FATTN_STRICT_SEQUENTIAL_DECODE env mode

Added env var that limits one slot's work per ubatch at both prompt-loading and decode-token-add steps in `server-context.cpp`. Combined with `--no-cont-batching`, fully serializes concurrent requests.

**Empirical results** (with `LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1 LLAMA_FATTN_STRICT_SEQUENTIAL_DECODE=1 --no-cont-batching`):

| NP | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 | baseline |
| 2 concurrent | **2/2 byte-identical to NP=1** (full closure) |
| 4 concurrent | 3/4 byte-identical, 1 anomalous slot per run (varies across runs) |
| 8 concurrent | 4/8 byte-identical, 4 anomalous (varies) |

**At NP=2: COMPLETE byte-identity to NP=1 baseline.** Full determinism achieved at this NP.

**At NP>=4**: residual divergence is **non-deterministic across runs** (different slots diverge in different runs with same code). This rules out batching as the cause (which would be deterministic). The remaining source is CUDA-side timing / kernel-internal non-determinism (atomic order, scheduler interleaving, possibly cuda graph cache eviction).

### 15.18 Production recommendation

The full opt-in stack for determinism:

```
LLAMA_FATTN_PER_SLOT_KV_ENABLE=1 \
LLAMA_FATTN_STRICT_SEQUENTIAL_DECODE=1 \
llama-server [...] --no-cont-batching
```

**Determinism guarantees** (under this config):
- NP=1: byte-identical across runs.
- NP=2: byte-identical to NP=1 across concurrent requests (both slots).
- NP>=4: most slots byte-identical, ~10-50% anomalous per run.

**Perf cost**:
- ~12× slower per FA call than baseline wmma_f16 (FA opt-in).
- Sequential processing of concurrent requests → throughput at NP>1 ≈ NP=1 effective. Concurrent parallelism lost.

Final Step 7 status: `[~]` with NP=2 byte-identity FULLY bound, NP>=4 partial (3/4 to 4/8 byte-identical, residual non-deterministic). The non-deterministic residual at NP>=4 is the remaining workstream — likely requires CUDA-side determinism work (kernel atomics, stream sync ordering) which is beyond the FA scope.
