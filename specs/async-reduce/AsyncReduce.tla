------------------------------- MODULE AsyncReduce -------------------------------
(* AsyncReduce: TLA+ specification of the async F32 cross-device reduce
   protocol. Models per-device compute and comm streams, CUDA events, and
   consumer waits. Verifies deadlock-freedom, safety (no read-before-write
   of the reduced tensor), and termination under fair scheduling.

   The model abstracts to a 2-device system (matches our TU102 pair).
   The reduce is layer-iterated; layers process in sequence and each layer
   has its own per-device input, reduce kernel, and downstream consumer.

   Per device d ∈ {0, 1} and layer l ∈ 0..N-1:
     - compute_state[d, l]   ∈ {IDLE, COMPUTING_FFN, FFN_DONE, WAITING_REDUCE, CONSUMING}
     - comm_state[d, l]      ∈ {IDLE, PEER_COPY, REDUCE_KERNEL, REDUCE_DONE}
     - evt_input_ready[d, l] ∈ {NOT_SIGNALED, SIGNALED}
     - evt_reduce_done[d, l] ∈ {NOT_SIGNALED, SIGNALED}
     - reduced[d, l]         ∈ {UNDEFINED, COMPUTED}  (the reduced tensor for device d, layer l)

   Properties verified:
     - Safety: never read reduced[d, l] before it's COMPUTED (no race)
     - Liveness: every layer eventually reaches CONSUMING on both devices
     - Determinism (modeled separately by abstract output equality): the
       reduce kernel produces the same output regardless of stream
       interleaving, because the F32 add at the kernel level is fixed-order
       per cell.

\* OVERLAP-FRIENDLY: while a layer's reduce is in flight (REDUCE_KERNEL),
\* compute on the same device CAN be advancing on a later layer.
\* This is the perf invariant — we check that StartFFN(d, l+1) is
\* not blocked when comm_state[d, l] is in flight.
